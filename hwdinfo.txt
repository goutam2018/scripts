[1:03 PM, 11/19/2019] +91 90008 08000: Create a playbook that produces an output file called /root/hwreport.txt on managed nodes with the following information:
	Inventory host name
	Total memory in MB
	BIOS version
	Size of disk device vda
	Size of disk device vdb
	Each line of the output file contains a single key=value.
Your playbook should:
	
	Modify /root/hwreport.txt with the correct values
	If a hardware item does not exist, the associated value should be set to NONE
